# leaflet-challenge

The US Geological Survey tracks information on all Earthquakes within the United States and makes the data available to the public.

This projects uses HTML, Javascript, and the Leaflet Javascript library to generate an interactive map of the United States which uses marker color and size to 
indicate depth and magnitude of all Earthquakes within the past seven days.

The project includes one HTML page, one Javascript file, and a CSS style script to create the map.
